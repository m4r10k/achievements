# Achievements
This repository currently contains just a single .SVG file with various achievement graphics within. They are meant to **be printed** (yes, analouge, old school you know) and to handed over to your team members to honor their work.

The logos used are mostly open source ones and if not, I applogize that I have taken them to create my own new creative work in the context of achievements. If someone out there has a problem with it, let me know.

## Font
The font used for the achievement plates is **Comfortaa** from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa).

## ToDo
- split the large SVG files to single files...
- create thumbnails...

## Thumbnails and direct achievement download

The thumbnails are generated with some script foo. If you are interested, look into the build folder :)
